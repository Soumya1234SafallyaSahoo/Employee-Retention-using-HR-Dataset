Employee Retention Prediction using Machine Learning
üîç Project Overview
Built a machine learning model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company, helping HR teams proactively manage retention and reduce turnover costs.

‚ùó Problem Statement
Companies often face:

High attrition rates due to unmonitored employee satisfaction

Lack of predictive systems to identify at-risk employees

Delayed HR interventions, increasing hiring/training costs

‚úÖ Solution
A classification model using HR data to:

Predict employee exit based on satisfaction, work hours, promotion history, and salary level

Enable data-driven retention strategies

Visualize key attrition drivers for HR decision-making
